Greetings to all. This is my first project of this format. It is a "warm-up" for further use of accounts for mass mailing in whatapp. 
How it works: 
1. Enter our numbers in the field "Номер 1" and "Номер 2" through which they will communicate with each other (warm up).
2. To avoid instant account locks, we should use a separate ip proxy for each number. Fill in the fields "ip адрес для прокси 1" "ip адрес для прокси 2", specify the address:port. If the connection is to a closed proxy, then fill in the Login and password fields. (If you are connecting to an open proxy, you do not need to enter your username and password.)
3. After you have set the connection parameters, click on the "Run the program"
4. We are waiting for you to log in to both accounts.
5. After you have completed the authorization, click on the "Потвердить вход" button.
6. Next, the program itself will start working, which will send a message in the interval from 5 to 15 seconds and will receive a response from the second number.
